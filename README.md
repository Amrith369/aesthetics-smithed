# Aesthetics Datapack
Datapack that adds falling leaves &amp; fireflies to vanilla Minecraft.
<br>
Leaves fall often when you're around trees. Fireflies spawn semi-frequently in grassy areas early in the night (time 13500-19000).
<br><br>
Commands:<br>
/trigger amr.aesthetics.toggle.leaves - Toggle Falling Leaves On And Off
/trigger amr.aesthetics.toggle.fireflies - Toggle Fireflies On And Off
<br><br>
Please note:<br>
The toggle commands only disable local spawns (around the player executing the commands).
